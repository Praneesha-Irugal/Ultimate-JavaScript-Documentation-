## An introduction

**A Hight Level, Single Threaded, Garbage Collected, interpreted or Just in Time Compiled , Prototype-Based, Multi-paradigm, Dynamic Language with non-Blocking event loop, made famous for building websites.**

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.

There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
